# Contributing to cloudscribe

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to cloudscribe and its related projects, which are hosted on GitHub.
These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.
This document is just a first draft put together quickly because people are beginning to express interest in contributing, we expect this document to evolve over time.

## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to [abuse@cloudscribe.com](mailto:abuse@cloudscribe.com).

### Before You Do Any Work

A goal of this project is to be accepted into the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/). Probably this will only be possible if/when this project becomes popular. However, it will be a goal to transfer copyright ownership of all project code for all of the cloudscribe projects to the foundation. This means that to contribute any code to this project, you must also be willing and able to transfer copyright ownership of any code you submit to this project so that we will have the ability to later transfer it to the .NET Foundation.

For any contributions of more than a few lines of code, we will need a signed [copyright transfer statement](copyright-assignment.txt) before we can review your submission. Later, if these projects do become part of the .NET Foundation, the process will change and you will need to have [a contribution agreement on file with the foundation](https://cla2.dotnetfoundation.org/).

Please do not do any work that you plan to submit as a pull request before discussing it first. Before you do any significant work you should first open an issue indicating what you specifically are interested in working on. We can then have a discussion about whether what you propose is in line with our plans and direction for the project as well as whether the timing is right for the specifc changes you have in mind or whether there may be other planned things that should be done first. Later this issue can be referenced by a pull request.

Until we get to know each other, it is probably a good idea for new contributors to pick something relatively focused and small that they would like to work on. 
Try to follow [good open source contribution etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html), and try not to be a [code wanderer](http://weblogs.asp.net/gunnarpeipman/who-is-code-wanderer).

At the moment this set of projects has very little unit test code. That is something we would like to change and I can tell you that starting out by contributing some unit test code would be a very good way to to make a first positive impact on this project and begin to earn recognition and trust from the project maintainers.
