some arguments against using a base controller
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6119206/what-are-good-candidates-for-base-controller-class-in-asp-net-mvc

seems like a lot of what could be done in a base controller could also be done in extension methods

when you do use an extension method from inside a controller you have to use the this keyword to call the method, no problem but noteworthy becuase it is a little unexpected when the extension method is not found without the this keyword and compilation fails

I started doing alerts inside a base controller as in this article:
http://jameschambers.com/2014/06/day-14-bootstrap-alerts-and-mvc-framework-tempdata/

but then realized I could refactor that functionality as extension methods so they could be used from any controller without inheriting a base class
