MS seems to push bootstrap on us via project templates but Bootstrap is kind of large and bloated by default

I think we need to carefully review alternatives and figure out ways to make it flexible to use others even if we settle on one.

Even Dino Esposito in his 10 Good Practices for ASP.NET MVC Apps says Don't Use Bootstrap
http://www.codemag.com/Article/1405071

Obviously we have to use something. The challenge is how to stay loosely coupled.
People can copy and modify views of course if they want to make major changes to markup, but it would be nice to at least have a way to plugin css class names somehow instead of hard coding them in the views
