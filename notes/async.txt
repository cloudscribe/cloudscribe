a good introduction to async await, at about 25 minutes it is also about using the codeitright product for code quality analysis
but shows the correct way to use async await and common wrong way mistakes to avoid

2015-06-08 now using the asp.net 5 bits and identity bits shipped with VS 2015 RC1
I noticed all the async methods on UserStore<TUser> now have CancellationToken in the method signatures.
such methods are supposed to check the token periodically to see if cancellation has been requested

you can see how it is used in EF Identity implementation

A good rule of thumb is to use ConfigureAwait(false) unless you know you do need the context.

I think it is not possible to make async data access for sqlite or sqlce
update it seems async can be used even if the db only supports a single coonection thread at a time but more complex becase you ned to use locking

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25945223/xamarin-forms-using-sqlite-net-async

async methods cannot have output parameters or ref parameters


good example here of async data access

the above indicates that actually the async command methods like executereader have been there since 4.0 .net
with .NET 4.5 it can but does not have to be used even more async 
With .NET 4.5 developers using sequential access can further fine tune performance by selectively using NextResultAsync, ReadAsync, IsDBNullAsync, and GetFieldValueAsync<T>


    Use NextResultAsync whenever possible to handle packet processing asynchronously.
    Prefer ReadAsync in either mode. Again, much of the packet processing can be done asynchronously.
    Do NOT use IsDBNullAsync and GetFieldValueAsync in non-sequential mode. In this mode the columns are already buffered and you create Task objects for nothing.

For sequential mode, the decision to use GetFieldValueAsync is a bit more complicated. Daniel Paoliello explains,

    However, if you called Read in non-sequential access mode, or if you are using sequential access mode, then the decision is much harder as you need to consider how much data you need to read to get to your desired column and how much data that column may contain. If you’ve read the previous column, and the target column is small (like a Boolean, a DateTime or a numeric type) then you may want to consider using a synchronous method. Alternatively, if the target column is large (like a varbinary(8000)) or you need to read past large columns, then using an asynchronous method is much better. Finally, if the target column is massive (like a varbinary(MAX), varchar(MAX), nvarchar(MAX) or XML) then you should consider the new GetStream, GetTextReader or GetXmlReader methods instead.

There are advantages to using the stream-based methods when working large files stored in the database. For example, you can hand-off the stream to a WCF or ASP.NET response instead of bringing in the whole file into memory at one time. This is especially important for .NET developers because the large object heap is very susceptible to fragmentation.
