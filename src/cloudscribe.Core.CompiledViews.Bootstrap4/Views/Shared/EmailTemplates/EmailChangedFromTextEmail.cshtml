@model cloudscribe.Core.Web.ViewModels.Email.EmailChangedNotificationViewModel

@{
    Layout = "_LayoutEmailNotification";
    ViewData["Title"] = "Email Address Changed";
    ViewData["Site"] = Model.Tenant;
}

    This is to confirm that the Email address for your user account on the site @Model.Tenant.SiteName has been successfully changed away from @Model.OldEmail.

    If this is not the result of your own actions, then please contact the site administrator at @Model.SiteUrl
